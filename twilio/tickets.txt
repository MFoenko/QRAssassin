@1 -- Done.
Send text when web kill
If they webkill we should still send the text to the person killed if they have a phone

@2 -- Done. Caps at 3 legit text request. Then they cannot attempt to bind for 12 hrs.
Cap the number of binding requests they can send. That way one person doesn't use all of our texts.

@3 -- Done. Also set up a daily cron job to clear the hits everyday.
Record in the db the texts send from which server so we can keep track of when to switch over to the other
server to send since the text limit is 75.

@4
Add index.php files to indexes to block directory view of our files.


@5
Subfiles should also include the headers to go to home if not logged in. Ex. Phonebind
can go to w/o being logged.

@6  -- Done. Shows "No Target" if they have no target.
Show users name on the home page. Looks very bland w/o target.

@7
Mikhail. Set your Cron Jobs in php/chron.php for a Cron Job

@8 -- Done.
Updating the phone binding

@9
Documentation.

@10
Check headers. We need to put exit; after a header else the server will
still execute some of the code.

@11
For the killing do we set the victims game_id to null? (kill.php)
